## About the NASC

The National Association of Sentencing Commissions (NASC) is a non-profit organization that was created to facilitate the exchange and sharing of information, ideas, data, expertise, and experiences and to educate on issues related to sentencing policies, guidelines and commissions.

Every year, the NASC conference brings together judges, legislators, correctional officials, policy makers, academics, researchers, and practitioners from around the country to examine our nation's experiences with sentencing laws and practices and to discuss emerging issues and innovations.
